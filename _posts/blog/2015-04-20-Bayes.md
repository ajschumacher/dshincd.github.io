Last week in class, we started learning about Bayesian statistics. The more we talked about it, the more I found myself interested by the philosophy behind Bayesian thinking.

A quick look online points to an ongoing debate behind so called "Bayesians" and "Frequentists". Here's a quick overview of the debate.

[An explanation using a simplified example](http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2008/01/are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-or.html)

[A funny comic](https://xkcd.com/1132/)

My interpretation is that Frequentists make inferences based on generalized, parameterized, probabilities versus Bayesians, who make inferences based on prior probabilities and new evidence. That's a mouthful, but here's an example:

We assume that when flipping a coin, it is equally probable to flip a head or tails. A frequentist might say that because of our model, which is the assumption that the coin is fair, the probability is then 50%.

On the other hand, Bayesians make inferences based on statistical (experimental) evidence. For example, if we flip a coin 100 times and a head came up 50 times, we can infer from the data that the probability is 50%. If instead, we flipped a head 75 times out of 100, we might have reason to believe that the coin is not fair, and we might decide to update our "probabilities".

**Probability vs Likelihood**

When examining these differences, I came to understand the difference between "probability" and "likelihood" as they are used in statistics. 

Probability can be defined as the theoretical chance of achieving a certain result given a model/assumption we have made about that system. P(observation l model)

On the other hand, likelihood is a statement that can be made about a system based on some observation we have made about that system. L(model l observation)

**Why should we care?**

The goal of applied statistics is to make inferences based on "reality". We should be able to have a framework for udpating our models based on new evidence (a Bayesian concept) as well as a reliable method for testing our models (a Frequentist concept).

I think I'm just scratching the surface here, but it's an interesting discussion nonetheless.
